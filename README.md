Heart Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning
This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. It evaluates models like Logistic Regression, QDA, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to determine the most accurate approach.

Technologies Used :
Python: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Features:
. Data preprocessing for handling missing values
. Binary classification of heart disease presence
. Evaluation using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

Instructions:
Clone the repo:
bash
Copy code
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-diagnosis.git`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
`python heart_disease_diagnosis.py`
Results
Achieved ~85% accuracy using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
